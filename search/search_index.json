Today, robots are augmenting the capability of human workers in various industries: logistics, healthcare, agriculture, etc. The PARC Engineers league tasks participants to reimagine how humans can augment the capabilities of intelligent robots in a task of growing prevalence - autonomous parcel delivery. The challenge of the competition is to build software to operate a wheeled mobile robot to complete a delivery task including: navigating through a sidewalk, crossing the road using a crosswalk and navigating in a park to find the drop location. This competition would consist two phases: a simulation phase and a physical robot phase. Simulation Phase In this phase, teams would interact with the delivery robot in simulation (using the Gazebo Robot Simulator). Participants are required to write software to complete three crucial tasks for the operation of a delivery robot: Sidewalk following (with obstacle avoidance) Traffic sign detection and recognition Go-to-goal navigation (with obstacle avoidance) Participating teams will follow the instructions in this documentation to set up their PCs and download the complete simulation packages required to complete the tasks. Teams are required to complete and upload their solutions on or before the Phase 1 deadline. Following team evaluations, teams with the best solutions will qualify to compete in Phase 2. Physical Robot Phase In this phase, the qualified teams get a chance to refine and deploy their software on the physical robot \"Turtlebot 3 Burger\" to compete on the main competition day. First, a complete simulation of the competition environment would be provided to teams to integrate and their solutions from Phase 1. The task here is to operate the delivery robot to complete a delivery by moving from parcel pickup location to the drop-off location. Once satisfactory results are achieved in simulation, participants would be allowed to test their software on the physical robot virtually by reserving time on our booking calendar [to be provided]. To be allowed to compete on the final competition, teams must submit a report (including videos of their fully functional solution in simulation) and upload their code for review. How to Register Prospective teams are required to complete an online application .

It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. We have planned this competition around ROS because of its features as well as its widespread use in robotics research and industry. To get started with ROS (if you are a beginner), we recommend you follow the \"Beginner Level\" tutorials in the official ROS Tutorials . Ensure you complete at least the following: Chapter 5 (ROS Nodes): \"This tutorial introduces ROS graph concepts and discusses the use of roscore, rosnode, and rosrun commandline tools\" Chapter 6 (ROS Topics): \"This tutorial introduces ROS topics as well as using the rostopic and rqt_plot commandline tools.\" Chapter 12 (Writing simple publisher and subscriber in Python) Understand the core tools provided by ROS , including RViz, rqt_graph, Gazebo, etc. After you complete the required tutorials listed above, you can start setting up the workspace .

In this task, we have simplified the sidewalk following problem by adding lanes to the sidewalk. Hence, teams are required to develop software to navigate the robot within the lanes from start to end position. Bear in mind that along with lane following, the robot would be required to avoid obstacles which may lie in its path. Task 1 Goal: The goal of this task is to autonomously control the delivery robot from the robot start position to a goal location on the sidewalk. To do this, you need to develop software which processes sensory information from the robots sensors (camera and LiDAR) and generates velocity commands to control the robot's motion [see here for details]. Task Guidelines Note Make sure you have completed the Getting Started Tutorials before starting the tasks. 1. Launching the Task In a new terminal, run the following launch file to bring up the delivery robot in Gazebo and RViz: roslaunch parc-robot task1.launch You should see the display below in Gazebo. To the right, there's the robot and to the left is the orange-red sphere which represents the goal location . 2. Explore Multiple Routes We have prepared two pre-defined routes you can use as you develop your solution. The default route is route1 , but you can select the second route option ( route2 ) by passing the argument in the roslaunch command as follows: roslaunch parc-robot task1.launch route:=route2 We recommend you play around with at least these two routes to ensure your solution is robust to different start locations. 3. Preparing your Solution Your solution should be prepared as ROS packages to be saved in your solution folder [link to how to submit]. Create a launch file in your ROS package which runs ALL the code you need in your solution. Name this launch file: task1_solution.launch .

Task Rules and Scoring The time-limit to complete this task is 5 minutes (300 secs) . The task is ONLY complete when ANY part of the robot is inside the orange-red sphere (goal location marker).

Launching the Task In a new terminal, run the following launch file to bring up the robot in Gazebo and RViz: roslaunch turtlebot_parc turtlebot_parc.launch You should see the display below in Gazebo. To the right, there's the robot and to the left is the circular green marker on the wall which represents the final goal location . The arrow in the figure below shows the robot in the goal location, facing the circular green marker. The goal is to get as close to the green marker and then stop. The robot camera view is also show below. 2. Explore Multiple Routes We have prepared two pre-defined routes you can use as you develop your solution. The default route is route1 , but you can select the second route option ( route2 ) by passing the argument in the roslaunch command as follows: roslaunch turtlebot_parc turtlebot_parc.launch route:=route2 We recommend you play around with at least these two routes to ensure your solution is robust to different start locations. 3. Explore Multiple Start Delays We have provided a simple way to set arbitrary values for the traffic light durations such as red_green_duration , yellow_red_duration and green_yellow_duration . This can be done by passing an argument for any or all of them as follows: roslaunch turtlebot_parc turtlebot_parc.launch red_green_duration:=10 green_yellow_duration:=8 While developing, we recommend you play around with different values for the traffic light durations to ensure your solution is robust. 3. Preparing your Solution Consistent with the approach from Phase 1, your solution should be prepared as ROS packages to be saved in your solution folder. Create a launch file in your ROS package which runs ALL the code you need in your solution. Name this launch file: task_solution.launch . Hence, your solution should be run by calling the following commands simulatenously: In one terminal: roslaunch turtlebot_parc turtlebot_parc.launch In another terminal: roslaunch your-package-name task_solution.launch Note Ensure you DO NOT provide a solution with hard-coded positions for the robot to move to or hard-coded obstacle positions because in evaluation, the robot initial position and locations of obstacles would be randomized in the field.","title":"Developing in Simulation"},{"location":"phase2-instructions/simulation-mode/#developing_in_simulation","text":"The goal here is to solve the complete delivery robot navigation task which is a combination of the three tasks completed in Phase 1, namely: Sidewalk following (with obstacle avoidance) Traffic sign detection and recognition Go-to-goal navigation (with obstacle avoidance) In this Phase 2, you are required to do the following: Refine your solution to the different tasks to make sure they function as expected Combine your solutions together into one complete solution that manages the different tasks together in real-time (as shown in image above)","title":"Developing in Simulation"},{"location":"phase2-instructions/simulation-mode/#task_guidelines","text":"Note Make sure you have completed the Getting Started in Simulation before starting the task.","title":"Task Guidelines"},{"location":"phase2-instructions/simulation-mode/#1_launching_the_task","text":"In a new terminal, run the following launch file to bring up the robot in Gazebo and RViz: roslaunch turtlebot_parc turtlebot_parc.launch You should see the display below in Gazebo.
